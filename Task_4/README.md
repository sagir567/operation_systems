Reactor-based Server

This is a simple server implemented using a reactor design pattern. The server listens for incoming connections and handles data exchange between clients.

Getting Started

Prerequisites
C compiler (e.g., GCC)
POSIX-compliant operating system (Linux, macOS)
Building the Project
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/reactor-server.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd reactor-server
Build the server:
go
Copy code
make
Running the Server
After building the project, you can run the server by executing the react_server binary:

bash
Copy code
./react_server
The server will start listening on the specified port (9035 by default). You can connect to the server using a TCP client and send/receive data.

Customization
If you want to change the listening port or adjust any other server parameters, you can modify the source code accordingly. Refer to the comments within the code for guidance.

File Structure

main.c: The entry point of the server application.
reactor.h: Header file containing the definitions of the reactor and event-related structures, as well as function prototypes.
reactor.c: Source file implementing the reactor and its associated functions.
